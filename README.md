# N-Body Simulation using the Particle-Mesh (PM) Method

## Overview
This project implements an **N-body simulation** using the **Particle-Mesh (PM) method** to model the motion of particles under gravitational interactions. The simulation calculates the density field, particle trajectories, and visualizes the systemâ€™s evolution over time.

## Features
- Implements **randomized initial conditions** for particle positions in a 3D space.
- Uses the **Particle-Mesh (PM) method** to compute density fields efficiently.
- Visualizes the **density distribution** and **particle motion** over time.
- Optimized using **NumPy and SciPy** for performance.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
